# Phone Store
<br><br>
This is a console application for a phone store.<br>
It works like a prototype of a simple database.<br><br>
The user can add phones, delete phones and print reports.<br>
Currently, there are 4 types of reports:<br>
- Show all phones of the given name brand<br>
- Show all phones of a given form factor and screen size<br>
- Show the name of the brand with the maximum quantity of the phones<br>
- Show the most popular screen size<br>

# TO DO:
<br><br>
-> Modify report 4 to show 3 most popular screen sizes<br>
-> Take initial input from a text file<br>
-> Save the current list of phones to a text file (on quit)
